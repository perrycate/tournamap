## About this Site

Tournamap.gg is a site for visualizing the location of offline video
game tournaments. (Only Smash Ultimate is supported so far.) Each pin
represents an upcoming tournament, click on it for details.

## Why did I make this?

<s>I was bored idk</s> "Any tournaments happening near _____?" is a very common
question in my community (NorCal). Some crazy individuals, in response, handmade
and maintained a map showing where the locals are and when they happen. I thought
that was awesome, and decided to try to automate something similar.

## Data Source(s)

Data is pulled from [smash.gg](https://smash.gg) roughly
every half hour. We hope to eventually support other sources, such as
challonge.

## If your tournament isn't listed

1. Make sure your tournament listing is publicly visible and
   discoverable. Someone should be able to find the page from the
   internet without being logged in.
2. If your tournament was recently published, try waiting an hour. The
   data is updated every half hour, but it may take some time for the
   updated data to become visible.
3. If all else fails, email [admin@tournamap.gg](mailto:admin@tournamap.gg)
   with a link to your tournament so we can figure out why it isn't being shown.

## How to contribute

The source code for the project can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/perrycate/tournamap). All forms of contribution (code, comments, etc) are welcome!

I stream most Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays around 6:30 Pacific /
9:30 Eastern while working on the site.
