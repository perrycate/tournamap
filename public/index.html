        <h2>About this Site</h2>
        <p>
          Tournamap.gg is a site for visualizing the location of offline video game tournaments. (Only Smash Ultimate is
          supported so far.) Each pin represents an upcoming tournament, click on it for details.
        </p>
        <h2>Why did I make this?</h2>
        <p>
          <s>I was bored idk</s>
          "Any tournaments happening near _____?" is a very common question in my community (NorCal). Some crazy
          individuals, in response, handmade and maintained a map showing where the locals are and when they happen. I
          thought that was awesome, and decided to try to automate something similar.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Source(s)</h2>
        <p>
          Data is pulled from <a href="https://smash.gg/">smash.gg</a> roughly every half hour. We hope to eventually
          support other sources, such as challonge.
        </p>
        <h2>If your tournament isn't listed</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Make sure your tournament listing is publicly visible and discoverable. Someone should be able to find the
            page from the internet without being logged in.
          </li>
          <li>
            If your tournament was recently published, try waiting an hour. The data is updated every half hour, but it
            may take some time for the updated data to become visible.
          </li>
          <li>
            If all else fails, email <a href="mailto:admin@tournamap.gg">admin@tournamap.gg </a> with a link to your
            tournament so we can figure out why it isn't being shown.
          </li>
        </ol>
